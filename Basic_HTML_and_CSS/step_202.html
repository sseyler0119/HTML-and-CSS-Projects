			Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. <br>
			On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of,<br>
			every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. <br>
			The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, <br>
			ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, <br>
			every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, <br>
			every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, <br>
			hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, <br>
			every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," <br>
			every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there <br>
			-- on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.<br><br>

			The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. <br>
			Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors <br>
			so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters <br>
			of a fraction of a dot. <br>
			Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel <br>
			on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, <br>
			how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, <br>
			how fervent their hatreds. <br>
			Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, <br>
			the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe,<br>
			are challenged by this point of pale light. <br><br>

	<section class="blueBackground">
		<p>
			Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. <br>
			In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere<br>
			to save us from ourselves. The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. <br>
			There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate.<br>
			Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment <br>
			the Earth is where we make our stand. <br>
			It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. <br>
			There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits <br>
			than this distant image of our tiny world. <br>
			To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another,<br>
			and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.<br>
