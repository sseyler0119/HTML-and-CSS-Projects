		<h2>Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us.</h2>
		<p> On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of,
		every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate
		of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions,
		ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every
		hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every
		king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father,
		hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every
		corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every
		saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there -- on a
		mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>

		<h3>Think of the
rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in
glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a
fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the
inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely
distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their
misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent
their hatreds.</h3>
